### Summary

Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented, but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them “curriculum learning”.  Complete with examples of from shape recognition, language modeling, and more!

This semester, we are experimenting with a new format.  There will be a longer, 10-20 minute presentation at the start of each meeting, followed by the usual discussion.  We hope that the longer presentation will help those who struggle with reading academic papers to see how more experienced members approach reading papers.
