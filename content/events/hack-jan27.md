Summary:  Bored of homework? Tired of theory? Itching to actually implement something? Come to hack nights to solve data science challenges, implement a new algorithm, or work on machine learning homework if you need to! This is a great place to collaborate with other MSAIL members!  Last week, we explored text prediction with Markov Chains, and implemented some of the algorithms covered in the spectral clustering paper from Tuesday's reading group!
