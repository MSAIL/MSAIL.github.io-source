Title: Error-Correcting Output Codes
Date: February 16, 2016 7:00 PM

Category: Reading Group
Summary:  Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set of classes.  This paper compares existing approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed representation.  We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks.  WE also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning.  Finally, the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates.

This semester, we are experimenting with a new format.  There will be a longer, 10-20 minute presentation at the start of each meeting, followed by the usual discussion.  We hope that the longer presentation will help those who struggle with reading academic papers to see how more experienced members approach reading papers.
