Summary: Interested in machine learning?  Don't know where to start?  Never fear!  This Tuesday, we'll introduce you to machine learning and give a brief survey of its various applications.  In particular, we'll use **K-Means Clustering** to automatically separate plant species in a popular dataset!

**Interested in Machine Learning?  Don't know where to start?  Never fear!!**

This Tuesday, join **Aaron Pollack** and **Samuel Tenka** for an overview of machine learning and a brief survey of its various applications. Then we'll dive into
a hands-on Machine Learning project, in which we'll:

 0. visualize a dataset of flower measurements,
 1. wonder how to group the data-points into species,
 2. formalize this wonder as a problem in "Clustering",
 3. invent a fully-automatic Clustering algorithm,
 4. implement that algorithm using standard packages, and
 5. analyze algorithm performance.

By the end of our session, you'll have:

 * A Mental map of Machine Learning's lay of the land.
 * Experience using standard packages to analyze real data.
 * Enthusiasm to participate in more of MSAIL's activities!
