Title: Intro to Reinforcement Learning
Date: March 8, 2016 7:00 PM
Location: DOW 2166
Category: Reading Group
Summary:  Reinforcement learning is a general means to automatically learn strategies for solving problems that can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Since the MDP framework is widely applicable, reinforcement learning has been applied to solving problems ranging from videogames to adaptive prosthetics.  This talk aims to provide an intro to the field, but with more focus on the motivation and why this particular technique might be used for the job.

This semester, we are experimenting with a new format.  There will be a longer, 10-20 minute presentation at the start of each meeting, followed by the usual discussion.  We hope that the longer presentation will help those who struggle with reading academic papers to see how more experienced members approach reading papers.
