Title: Support Vector Machines
Date: March 8, 2016 5:30 PM
Location: DOW 2166
Category: Tutorial
Summary:  Interested in Machine Learning?  Don't know where to start?  Never fear!  This Tuesday, we'll put to use all the intuition we've built for regression, classification, and high-dimensional data, by developing the Support Vector Machine classification and regression algorithms. Along the way, we'll encounter the perceptron algorithm and the Kernel Trick, which, extended in a different direction, leads to Neural Nets, a subject of future tutorials.
