Summary:  If data really is as big as they say, it's useful to be able to visualize it!  Us puny humans have trouble visualizing more than three dimensions, so dimensionality reduction techniques are often applied to compress the meaningful information contained in a dataset to a form that's easily interpreted!  Among this interesting class of algorithms are PCA, ICA, LSH, and many more!  Tonight, we'll be talking about t-SNE, a dimensionality reduction algorithm with a clever underlying probabilistic model.

This semester, we are experimenting with a new format.  There will be a longer, 10-20 minute presentation at the start of each meeting, followed by the usual discussion.  We hope that the longer presentation will help those who struggle with reading academic papers to see how more experienced members approach reading papers.
