Join us for our first ever hack night!  Bored of homework?  Tired of theory?  Itching to actually <em>implement something</em>?  Come to hack nights to solve data science challenges, implement a new algorithm, or work on machine learning homework if you need to!  This is a great place to collaborate with other MSAIL members!
