Title: Regression Part II

Location: DOW 2166
Category: Tutorial
Summary:  Interested in Machine Learning?  Don't know where to start?  Never fear!  This Tuesday, we'll continue discussing *linear regression*, that is, how to use lines to fit a dataset. In particular, how do we deal with large numbers of variables? With nonlinear data? With small datasets, where there is a risk of learning spurious patterns (aka overfitting)? By the end of the session you'll have obtained an elegant weapon against the complexity of data.

**What if I missed last week?**  Come anyway!  We're continuing with regression, so there's plenty of opportunity to catch up!
