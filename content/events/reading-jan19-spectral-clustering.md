Summary:  Spectral clustering is a competitive, easy-to-implement clustering method that draws on a lot of interesting topics, including linear algebra, graph theory, and a classic problem in computer science!  This is a difficult paper, but don't worry, we're here to help!  Join us on Tuesday, where we'll work through the paper together to build up some intuition.

### Core Paper

### Summary

Spectral clustering is a competitive, easy-to-implement clustering method that draws on a lot of interesting theory.  I think this paper is perfect for our first meeting of the semester for several reasons:

- Spectral clustering is based on linear algebra, graph theory, and a classic problem in computer science!  
- It's the perfect example of an academic paper.  Some parts are difficult to read, but overall there is plenty of intuition and good discussion.
- The algorithm is presented from several different points of view, which will hopefully lead to good discussion.

This is a **difficult** paper, but don't worry!  We're here to help.  Especially if you're new to this, the hope is that you will get practice reading papers, even if you don't understand everything.  We certainly don't!  At the meeting, we'll work through the paper together and try to build up some intuition.  The best thing to do is ask lots of questions!

This semester, we are experimenting with a new format.  There will be a longer, 10-20 minute presentation at the start of each meeting, followed by the usual discussion.  We hope that the longer presentation will help those who struggle with reading academic papers to see how more experienced members approach reading papers.
