## Tutorial Series
### Tuesdays @ 5:30pm in DOW 2166

Each week, MSAIL holds seminars targeted at students lacking any formal training in Machine Learning or those wishing for a quick refresher on basic topics. These seminars are led by **Aaron Pollack** and **Sam Tenka**, and cover basic topics relating to the application of machine learning to data science problems. No theoretical familiarity with machine learning is required.  Always wondered what a support vector machine is? Want to know how to predict the chances of [surviving the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)?  This is the place for you. Check the calendar for the seminar schedule and the Github repo for the material we plan to cover!

## Machine Learning Reading Group
### Tuesdays @ 5:30pm in DOW 2166

Read and discuss machine learning papers with other students from all across campus!  We aim to help students study topics in machine learning beyond the scope of an intro course.  Our readings will usually be focused on papers that are either fundamental in some way to the field of machine learning (the ones you see cited in textbooks!) or that explore the deeper connections between seemingly disparate subfields.  Together, we'll all work hard to learn new material, drawing examples and applications from the experiences of our members.  Meetings consist of a brief, informal presentation of the week's reading followed by a 30-40 minute group discussion.  Organized by **Ben Bray**, **Alex Chojnacki**, and **Sam Tenka**.

## Hack Nights
### Tuesdays @ 5:30pm in DOW 2166

Bored of homework?  Tired of theory?  Itching to actually <em>implement something</em>?  Come to hack nights to solve data science challenges, try out new algorithm, or work on machine learning homework with friends!  This is a great place to collaborate with other MSAIL members!  This semester, **Spencer Buja** and **Cheng-Yu Dai** will be working through projects and exercises from [*Artificial Intelligence:  A Modern Approach*](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), and **Ben Bray** will be implementing algorithms from papers covered in the reading group!

## Michigan Data Science Team
### Thursdays @ 7:00pm in DOW 3150

Work on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions in the first competitive university team in the country. Organized by **Jonathan Stroud** and advised by [Professor Jacob Abernethy](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/), participate in Machine Learning competitions that challenge the limits of data science. You will read papers to learn cutting-edge ML techniques used to solve problems in domains outside of Computer Science, while collaborating with others doing the same and learning a lot along the way! Visit the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) at [umdst.com](umdst.com) for more information. You can find meeting times either there, or on our [schedule page](http://mdst.eecs.umich.edu/calendar/).
